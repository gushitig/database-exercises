Setting up Sample DB

don't have enough time to go in depth to setting up your own server, but highly recommended
check out MariaDB 100% compatible w mySQL and totally free

1. SHOW DATABASES;
2. use ymir_employees;
3. show tables;
4. select * from employees;
iff you want the count of your record search:
select count(emp_no) from employees;
its important for every entry in a table to be unique, typically done by an id in this db its by employee number

normalization - taking tables
duplication in data is also bad
focused lil tables simplify
can connect those tables together
